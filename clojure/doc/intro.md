# Introduction to evolution-programs

I am currently away reading [Jacob Kaplan-Moss](http://jacobian.org/)'s post on how to write
[great documentation](http://jacobian.org/writing/what-to-write/). You should see something interesting here once I've
digested it. Till then, the [README](https://github.com/dexterous/evolution-programs/tree/master/clojure#readme) will
just have to do.
