# Data Mining Experiments

A bunch of data mining experiments for my IS665 course at Pace University.

We started with 'R' in class and when the Professor asked us to look at implementations and libraries on other platforms
'Clojure' was my natural first choice. I found [clj-genetic](https://github.com/beloglazov/clj-genetic) and its
simplicity suited my needs at this stage. I'll probably add more experiments here as the course progresses.
